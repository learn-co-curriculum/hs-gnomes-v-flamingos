<img src="http://images1.westword.com/imager/lawn-gnomes-slightly-less-sad-than-lawn-f/u/original/6477020/08gnome.jpg" width="300px" align="right" hspace="5"> The Garden Gnomes and Lawn Flamingos have a long standing feud. Today they will engage in an epic battle to find a winner. Run `rspec --fail-fast` to follow along with the specs to create a garden gnome and lawn flamingo armies and a battle. **Start out with Battle class but note that you might need to start creating your Garden Gnomes and Flamingos before you can pass all the Battle specs.**
