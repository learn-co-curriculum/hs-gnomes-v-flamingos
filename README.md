Today they will engage in an epic battle. Run `rspec --fail-fast` to follow along with the specs to create garden gnome and lawn flamingo armies and  battle.

**Start out building the Garden Gnome class, but note that you might need to build out parts of the Flamingo class to make the Garden Gnome specs pass.**
